
- Dynamically creating form elements depending upon the answer of the previous question
- Dynamic creation of at least 3 sets of <select><option>value
- At least 2 choices for each selection
- My topic is Anime Genre
- print out the final choice/ show all the local storage at the bottom of the page
- Clear button for the user clear the local storage
- submit button to submit to the local storage, 
and the page will show user selection at the bottom of the page
- Validate before submitting, user need to input their name and have to 
pick all the selection options. The page will show an alert if the user misses something
when they submit. And tell which one is missing.
- Create a unique key to the local storage, so if the user pick the same selection
local storage won't replace it. Keep all the data.
