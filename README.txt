Iâ€™ve done:
- Dynamically creating form elements depending upon the answer of the previous question
- Dynamic creation of at least 3 sets of <select><option>value
- At least 2 choices for each selection
- My topic is Anime Genre
- print out the final choice/ show all the local storage at the bottom of the page
- Clear button for user clear the local storage
- submit button to submit to the local storage, 
and the page will show user selection at the botton of the page
- Validate before submit, user need to input their name, and have to 
pick all the selection option. The page will show alert if user miss something
when they submit. And tell which one is missing.
- Create unique key to the local storage, so if user pick same selection
local storage won't replace. Keep all the data.
- use local storage 
- data files are separated
- name my main page index.html
- Didn't post this on the internet
- Didn't use innerHTML
- New selection shows from making a previous select. No need to click a button.
- Minimal HTML
- after submit, the webpage will refresh and update. User can start new choices
- everything done in css, no table and bootstrap
- did not use show/hide selection, everything is dynamically



Extra:
- Professional looking
- Use local storage
- In the third select option, user can either choice image or Video 
	1. If user choose image, user can mouseon the image which will
	   show some animation on the image.

	2. If user choose video clip, they can click on it and watch a clip.

- slide show: an image gallery for all the anime on the top of the webpage.
This animation will run automatically without any user action.
